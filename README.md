# MUI course
This course is provided by [lamadev youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzxEECHnsvU&pp=ygUMbXVpIGxhbWEgZGV2)

## Aim of this repository
This repository includes the code that I wrote during this course along with some notes I wrote .

### Why use this repository and not the one provided in the video ?
When I tried to use MUI with the one provided in the video (which uses create react app). I got a bunch of errors when I tried to use mui . The errors were all about conflicting modules . And I was just focusing on studying MUI and not solving problems between dependencies, so I used vite instead (and it did great !) .

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
